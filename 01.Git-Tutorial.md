### This is First Commit


- Branch: By default we start off with a single branch called Master, which is the default branch for most Git and GitHub repositories.
- Clone: clone the repository, which is the act of copying this repository in GitHub to our local system. 
- Clone with HTTPS: It is a special web address which allows Git to clone or copy this repository down to the local system.

Clone:

```git
1. Go into our projects folder 
2. From this point we can use the Git clone command to copy the repository from Github down to our local system
$ git clone 'address.com'
// paste "Shift+Ins"
// There is one other parameter, which at the end we can specify a different folder name to create when cloning down
$ git clone 'address.com' demo
```

```git
// My prompt changed to put in parenthesis the name of branch, "master", which is the same branch we start out with on GitHub
// I am always working on branch and in Git the main or default branch is "master"

// This will tell us the current state of our Git repository and confirm that we are still on the master branch
$ git status

// our branch is up to date with "origin/master"
// generally origin is where we came from, /master is the master branch on GitHub.
// Our local branch of master is up to date with out GitHub branch on master
```

```git
// This will show us the commit history for this repository which is the same thing as going to the commit tab on GitHub
$ git log

```

### First Local Commit

- What's the deal with this long string of characters next to the word commit?

- Git works by having a series of commits on a timeline. Each commit is uniquely identified, and so this long string of characters is the commit ID.
- This ID ensures that across multiple repositories each of these commits should be unique



- "git status" shows us that we have a new untracked file. In Git, files can be tracked or untracked. "Untracked" simply means that Git is not keeping track of the file. The moment we add this file to Git, it will be tracked from that point forward.

- Git uses two stages commit process:

  - First: stage the file by using **the add command**

    warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in LICENSE.txt.

    - This is because we want it to convert all of our windows-based line endings to the UNIX-based line endings

    // Changes to be committed:

    - Git shows us changes to be committed, which is another way of saying that we're currently in the staging area for Git.

  - Second: **the commit command** to commit anything that is currently staged and permanently record those changes into the Git repository.

### Push Back to GitHub

- We don't have our license file in GitHub repository yet, which means our changes are still our local repository.
- This is an important distinction because although they may be linked together by using their remote commands to exchange commits back and forth, each repository maintains its own history. Back in our local repository, I can see we have two comments.

- In Github commit tab, we still only have one commit. In order to fix it that, we have to make them work together.

- Whenever you clone the repository into your local system, Git automatically creates a reference back to GitHub and that reference is named **Origin**. **The Git remote series of commands** deals with everything related to managing the remote side of any repositories.

- One of the options is the **"-v"** which shows us which remote repositories are configured. In doing so, it actually duplicates each entry with a fetch entry and a push entry. 

- That's because Git supports the idea that for each remote reference we can have a fetch or read URL and a push or write URL. However, almost always these are the same.

- Now that we know we have a remote reference named origin, we can get more information about it by using the remote show command, passing in the name "origin" to get more details

- Again, it tells us that there is a fetch URL and a push 
- Again, most of the time they are the same.
- And that we're using master on basically both the local and remote repositories.
- Now we know the name of the remote repository, we need to send our changes to.
- We also know that we've been working on a branch called master.
- We need both pieces of information to use in conjunction with **the "git push" command**, which actually pushes the changes from a local repository up to our remote repository, that is GitHub!
- git push "the name of the remote reference" "the name of the branch the push"

```git
// By default that means that we're going to look for a corresponding branch called master within origin
$ git push origin master
```

- In doing so, we get a nice little summary about what happened. In the end, that is where we are sending our changes. 
- And we see that we have sent this commit point(3a8ca68) to this commit point(5a3d117), 
- or master to master (our local master to our remote master)
